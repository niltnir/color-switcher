# Color_Switcher

## Introduction

Here's a [link](https://okimath.com/cs00/color_switcher.html) to a working
version. The text is in Japanese, but hopefully, the interface is intuitive
enough to grok.

The game comes from a simple math olympiad
[problem](https://aops.com/community/p7622138) I found a long time ago.
The idea is to invent an algorithm to make all the cells in the grid reach the
same parity (color in the case of *Color Switcher*, key direction in the case
of the math problem).

The surprising part is how little knowledge is actually required to solve the
problem. Primary students with problem-solving backgrounds have a good chance
of figuring it out.

Because I made the game for a [Japanese content creator](https://okimath.com), there
are corresponding videos for the
[problem](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=UdLtG_SBymA) and
[solution](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=zagKmjLQaw0) in Japanese.

## Installation/Usage

You can download the source directly, or run
